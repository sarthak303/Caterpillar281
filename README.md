# AI-Powered CAT Inspect Application

## Overview

The AI-Powered CAT Inspect Application is a cutting-edge tool designed to automate the equipment inspection process. By leveraging advanced technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, and machine learning, this application streamlines the inspection workflow, from video capture to comprehensive report generation. It enhances accuracy, reduces manual effort, and ensures that no critical detail is overlooked during inspections.

## Key Features

- **Automated Workflow:** Manages the entire inspection process, from video recording to generating detailed reports, significantly reducing the technician’s workload.
- **Voice-Enabled Inspections:** Enables technicians to conduct inspections using voice commands, allowing for hands-free operation and eliminating the need for manual data entry.
- **NLP-Powered Data Prioritization:** Utilizes advanced NLP algorithms to prioritize and highlight critical defects in the inspection report, ensuring key issues are addressed.
- **Real-Time Image Capture:** Prompts technicians to capture images based on detected keywords, integrating visual evidence directly into the report.
- **Multilingual Support:** Supports inspections in multiple languages, making the application accessible to a diverse workforce.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Automatically generates detailed inspection reports that include text summaries, images, and action recommendations, with export options available.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle inspections across various types of equipment and industries.
- **Seamless Integration:** Easily integrates with existing maintenance and reporting systems for smooth data transfer and analysis.

## Technology Stack

- **Python:** Backend development, integrating various tools and handling data processing.
- **SpeechRecognition:** Converts audio from inspection videos into text format.
- **NLP (spaCy, NLTK):** Analyzes transcribed text to extract and prioritize critical keywords.
- **FuzzyWuzzy:** Performs fuzzy string matching to compare and match similar phrases in the text.
- **MoviePy:** Processes video files, extracting audio for transcription.
- **PyDub:** Manages audio processing tasks, converting and manipulating audio formats.
- **OpenCV:** Handles image processing, capturing frames from video for inspection documentation.
- **HTML/CSS:** Structures and styles the user interface for a clean and accessible design.
- **SQL/MySQL:** Stores and retrieves inspection data, including text, images, and reports.
- **Flask/Django:** Builds the web application's frontend and backend interface.
- **Docker:** Ensures consistent deployment across different environments.
- **Git:** Version control for tracking code changes and collaborative development.
- **Cloud Storage (AWS S3):** Securely stores video files, images, and large datasets.

## Solution Description

This application automates equipment inspections by taking video inputs from technicians. The video is processed to extract the audio, which is then converted into text using speech recognition technology. NLP algorithms analyze the transcribed text to identify and prioritize key issues such as "broken," "leak," or "rust." The application automatically fills out inspection forms, categorizes issues by urgency, attaches relevant images, and generates a comprehensive report, reducing manual data entry and enhancing inspection accuracy.

## How It Works

1. **Video Capture:** The technician records the inspection using a mobile device or camera.
2. **Audio Extraction:** The system separates the audio from the video.
3. **Speech-to-Text Conversion:** The extracted audio is converted into text format.
4. **NLP Analysis:** The transcribed text is analyzed to identify critical keywords and prioritize them based on context and severity.
5. **Automated Form Filling:** The system automatically fills in the inspection form, categorizing issues and attaching relevant images.
6. **Report Generation:** A detailed inspection report is generated, including text summaries, images, and recommended actions.
7. **Multilingual Support:** The inspection can be conducted in multiple languages.
8. **Export and Integration:** The report can be exported as a PDF and integrated with existing maintenance systems.
